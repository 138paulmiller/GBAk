## GBAk
A complete and simplified Gameboy Advance development Kit.
Contains the binaries of a GCC ARM Cross-compiler. 
The arm-agb-elf-gcc targets the AGB processor of the GBA.  

The install script downloads and makes map editing tools created by github.com/IanFinlayson. 
#### Setup Environment:
- Set GBAK variable:
	sudo echo export GBAK=/path/to/gbak >> .bashrc
- Install tools:
	./install

#### Build
This also comes packaged with a Makefile to simplify compilation.
The Makefile assumes c source files are located inside a src/ directory, 
and looks for header inside a inc/ directory.
- First move source code into the inc and src directories
- To Build 
	cd path/to/gbak
	make
This will export demo.gba file that can be loaded by an emulator.
To change the output name, modify the OUT variable in the makefile.
If you are on linux you can install visualboyadvance with
	sudo apt-get install visualboyadvance
and use it to load the .gba file with
	gvba demo.gba
